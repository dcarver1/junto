Goals
1. Tell a personal story of implement innovation
2. provide a framework for understanding perceptions of innovations
3. Show the factors effective the success of implementation
4. Give tips on how to make it stick.


# What is innovation
## define
There are lots of ways to look at innovation. For this presentation it is simply going to be the intentional change of a system or process.
While personal innovation is an important, within this talk we
will be talking specifically about innovation within the an institutional structure.


## explain layout of presentation
The main point of this talk is to provide some theoretical framework for
assessing if an given innovation is likely to stick.
The systems and ideas will likely not be new but it giving them a solid and

Questions; why does some innovation stick and others don't

# story 1 (gorilliz rock the house)
## starting work
In a city far away and in a time long ago a eager student walked into his first
day of work.

## explain background

This person had worked in a government job before so he knew things would start
out slow. That said he wanted to make a difference in his work place and went in
with a critical eye of how it could be made better. Because it was an IT job it
gave him the ability to more or less walk into anyone's office on official business.
So he made it a point to talk to people about what they did and try to learn all
the cogs that kept this machine rolling.   

## summer
Through the summer he settled into the work routine which involved a lot of
software installations. Because he found himself doing the same thing over and
over he though "Hey can't I make the computer do this boring stuff"

## installing software
He spent some time developing a script that did just that. It wasn't a drastic
change but is help with the consistnecy of the process and did make it more
efficent. Once tested he spoke to his boss about it. It fit well with the direction
the group wanted to go so she improved it for use within the IT department.   


# Innovation Heros (current prime minister of Canada)
I don't know if i need this here. It's similar to the
## modern culutal idea of change

For better or worst were feed the story of the hero non stop through out our life.
It is an engrained part of out our cultural identity and often mistaking apply
the ideal to situtations that are not really appropriate. Such as who makes
innovation happen.

## Flaws in the simple argument

The actions of the individual is inctredible important in creating and maintaining
change, but it is wrong to view those actions in insolation to the structural and
cultural constrains that the individual must successfully work within.

## the power in immplement relies in those most effected by it

A more effective way to look at the role of the individual is by understanding
that the power to implement change relies on those most effected by in.




# Innovation and Institutional Theory
theoritcal framework of analysis

## Rational choice theory
> emphasizes the individual's role in innovation processes

- People will logically understand what is best for them and go with that
- supports the idea of the policy heros; actor > structure

Individuals promote change because it is know that it is most benifical for them to change. This means change occurs when individuals are not content with the current course of action. Due to the inherent valuing of individuals, innovation will only persist for as long as it proves more valuable then other options.
Assumes full knowledge of the cost and benefits of actions.

## Historical Institutional Theory

While individuals are still responsible for creating innovation the focus is shifted to the structure that the individual is working within. Not all individuals have the same ability to indicate innovation and often actions are obstructed if the changes brought about through the innovation negatively effect those with the most power. This structure also constrains the rate of change at which innovation can take place.

> The implication is that individuals seeking change in the status quo must operate within a historical institutional structure, which is characterized by substantial inertia and tendencies toward maintaining the status quo.

- historical inertia: institutions move forward based on past decisions
- Valuation of the structure in which innovation is implemented

### Sociological Institutionalism

> considers the larger cultural and cognitive aspects that frame the institutional structures within which innovation takes place

Largely a counter to the rational choice theory, sociological institutionalism believe that there are a multitude of reason as to why individual seek innovation. It rejects that idea that individuals make choice because they are the most efficient or best suited and focuses more on the concept of 'embeddedness'. This is a term to describe how once an individual has created a specific routine it becomes the right way. This routine can entrench individuals because it create the frame of thought from which it becomes more and more difficult to see out off.  This "schemata of interpretation" as defined by Goffman, allows individuals "to locate, perceive, and label" the experiences that have in the world. It is these predetermined  relationships that will foremost define the willingness of an individual to accept a particular change. What is essential to keep in mind is that because of this embeddedness it is not fair to expect individuals to understand the multitude of cultural, political, and social influences that are effecting their own personal beliefs. We struggle to see out of our own frame of reference.

- Places institutions within larger social structures
- Individual embeddedness: Routines lead to defined framework from which it is very
difficult to see outside off.
- Individuals are not entire aware of the cultural, social, political structure
that effect thier decision making.






# story 2 (last living soal)

Work was moving along well. The summer was over and the amount of time he was
spending at work dropped. The work seems really reactionary. There were time
when lots was happening and other time when little was going one. To try to find
a more active role her decided he needed to reach out.

## spreading out

He knew many of his co workers out there were good coders. Keeping it all very
informal he starting asking them what were some boring things they did that they
tought could be automated with programming.

## communicating with others

The response was slow, but one idea did pop up. Before starting work on a new
dataset individuals within this group manual check each column of these feature
classes for words that did not match the correct format. They found them and fixed
them. It usually did not take more then ten minutes, but no one liked doing it.

## make computers do the boring stuff

working with one person from the team they collaborate and hacked something
together that did the job. Now they could run a code instead of checking on boxes

## defining the boundaries

Because it worked the team member took it to her boss. You needed to run the code
via command line and the boss didn't like that. So he reached out to the developing
branch of the organization and ask them for a button instead. All of the sudden
this project went from a conservation between two friends to a work order and email
string between the managers of multple groups. The scope and idea was rapidly changing
into something else.


# Factors effecting acceptance
## Individual effected by the change
Motivation
 - what is the buy in of those who are effecting by the change
Norms
 - Workplace identity; willingness to Change
Harmony
- Will the change negatively effect someone position

## Structural of the organization
Rules
- the right and wrong
Methods for communication
- how effectively does communication move up and down the organizational structure
resistance
- who forces are trying to stop the change

## Cultural
Shocks
- large changes that shift people out of there framework
Framing
- large ideas and plans that point to a specific direction.
Legitimacy
- how does this tie into larger cultural ideas of what is right or admired

## Why it is some important to make it all fit
When thinking about these structures you need to understand the relationships
between them. Your most like able to effect the individuals.
Understand the importance of working within the cultural and institutional structures


# story 3 ( )
## new opportunity
He knew that this job was going to change in a couple months. Either they hired
him as an employee or said good bye. He began to think, what would his ideal job
in the organization be. Could that change happen  

## devising plan
He had the idea of working half the time for IT and half the time for an other group
The big selling point he came up with was that Working in two groups would inherently improve communication between the groups. It would also allow him to support his
current team and grew in a direction he wanted.

## seeking advise

He reached out a mentor in a department he wanted to work with. He thought it was
a good idea and should ask some higher ups about it. So he went out and did. He
new many of the admin staff from working on there computers so it made starting
the communication easier  

## reaching out

He spoke to the one person who thought is was interesting but wasn't sure how it
fit within the hiring structure. They wanted to keep talking about it though.
The next person he spoke too said that they needed to get hired on as an employee
before they could really talk about the split time idea.

## making the call
He struggle with the uncertainty, would it work. Would he be stuck in IT until the end of time? Was that ok. Would he be able to split the time and make the most of time for the
organization? The question the it came done to was will the change stick. This felt like a major career decision and it was based only on a possibility. He want to do all he could to understand the likelihood that possibility before make his choice.


# Making it all work
tie this back to the story elements review why they did
or didnot work summarizing into three main points
## story 1
illustrated rational choice theory.
The individual was motived the change mostly effect the person pushing the changes
It match the structural rules and regs of the department, mostly.  
It built on the cultural idea of reproducibility and effency and frame well to his boss
It didn't sick because it was written in a programming language not used by many memebers of the group Never really developed a team of support with the project
## story 2
The idea was pushed by two people but needed to be accepted by many. It mostly
effect the others.
No one from the IT department had tried to collaborate in this manor before so
managers had to think a bit about supporting the idea at all
This really was an effiency matter so it was deemed agreeable by the managers but
there was no real shock or framing
This did stick, but it also became a lot stickier. The managers were unsure if
this really fell within the job description. The programming department didn't
want anything to do with it. Yet I don't see it lasting long term because
automation is a really threat to many of the jobs. Sure it's boring but it's what
I do.


## story 3
Clearly this was someone pushing for a change that mostly effected them.
No one had tied this process before so it was unclear what the rules were regarding it
Recent changes in poltical structure put a lot of uncertainty into the workplace
The result of this was unknown. Mutliple people were on though it could work but
the consensous was "Get hired on first, then we can think about it"
This person decided to take a different job. One that they knew they would not
believe in everyday

# Key points
Respect the complexity of the process
View the situtation through multiple theoritical frames to help you see outside
of you own embeddedness

## You must be invested
Don't expect anyone else to make it happen for you
## Take time to understand the norms, culture, and structure
Your not a hero. Don't try to rewrite the rules. Know how to work within them
## seek the buy in of others
Teams are stronger
## Frame your ideas
People react better to ideas that they see coming
## prepare for the opportunity
Unfortunitly most changes happen as a result of shocks to the system.
Understand how larger changes create opportunity and be ready
## watch out for brick walls
Change is hard... understanding that there is a lot more that goes into making it
stick will help you stay standing tall when your idea don't


#thank you (superfast jelly fish )
## ask to take some time to reflect on changes within your
own groups that were successful
## talk and review of the book chapter is up on github
it doesn't seem to be recognizing changes
