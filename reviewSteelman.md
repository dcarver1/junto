This is a review of the first chapter from the book ** Implementing Innovation**
by Toddi A. Steelman. I read the chapter as a article for my environmental
management course and was significantly impacted by it. Mainly due to these
theoretical framework that the text provides. This framework is no so much a
set of solution for implementing innovation as much as a means of thinking about
the complexity of the process. Gaining this ground to stand allows one to better
evaluate the unique complexity of any given situation.
The best way to evaluate the complexity is to view the process as a network of
relationships. This requires identifying your own place within the network and
the understanding of some of the existing relationships and norms.

#Innovation, Implementation, and Institutions
## The problem with innovation
A lot of time and effort is put into implementing innovation within institutions,
yet the truth is that these innovations are often not accepted or sustained. The
goal of the chapter is to understand why some innovations are implemented and
others are number_of_elements_to_remove

## Implementing innovation in an institutional context
Among those who study institutional change there is a common division between
public management, policy studies, and implementation theory and institutional
theory. The first set of three are based more on the actually of what is happening
in specific situations. Institutional theory is more suited for framing the
overarching structures from which an individual or institution is working within.
Integrating these frameworks allows for the defining of ideal conditions for
innovation within Institutions.
1. Individuals are motived and well set within the cultural norms of the
organization. One of with organizations norms needs to be a willingness to accept
innovation.
2. Structures exist that allow for communication among different levels of the
organization, clear incentive for adapting to the innovation, an awareness of the
means used to resist change.
3. plan for framing the innovation, making the most out of shocks, and knowing
how to use innovation as a means legitimacy.
The reality is that rarely do all these conditions exist at once. Therefore it
is a fallacy to simply which for the perfect time. Implementing innovation
successful is a real challenge that requires incentive and timing. It is best
to focus on understanding obstacles within the specific institution rather then
those they may effect the long term accepts of innovation.

## What is Innovation
> Laurence O'Toole defines policy innovation as "patterns of activities to achieve a new goal or improve the pursuit of an established one."

> Everett M Rogers, famously characterized innovation from an individual's
standpoint. For Rogers, an innovation is an idea, practice, or object that is
perceived as new by the individual adopting it.

>Consequently, innovation is an end result as well as a process.

The take away here is that innovation is not a easily defined process or result
so it is inherently difficult to speak about. Since innovation can be perceived
as the implementation of an object, technology development often takes the case
for what successful implementation is. This is a challenge because the adaption
of a new technology often does not take into account the cultural components of
the institution adapting it. As a result it is easy for my to disassociate
innovation with the human aspect of the institution. This separation make it
challenging to ensure long term success of the innovation.

The next bit of the chapter goes on to talk about the different categories of
innovation. Four categories were defined based on the involvement of government
and the focus on binding and nonbinding action. While this classification would
have value in the comparison of case studies, it is a little to detailed for
an audience who is going to focus on changes within their own institution.

## Innovation, Implementation, and Policy Entrepreneurs
> Almost universally the institutionalism perspective is ignored, leading to
overly optimistic expectations for innovations' potential.

> There is an overall failure to acknowledge the broader structural and cultural forces at play that can facilitate or obstruct the longer term success of the innovation.

We love our hero. In part because it is simple and makes for a good story, but also because it helps us reaffirm our own ability to change to the direction of a force larger then ourselves. Success stories of innovation are no different. Incredible people, fighting for what they want, and making it happen regardless of the circumstances. It would seem that youth tends to bite on to this ideal a bit a more then the older members of the workforce. The detrimental aspect of this mindset is that it leads to a lack of focus on the structural issues at hand that will greatly effect the long term success of the innovation. The big walk away is that individuals matter, they matter a lot, yet at the end of the day they are really just a piece of the puzzle. Moving away from the concept of focusing solely on the individuals role is a great first step in

## Innovation and Implementation
>  The power to implement an innovation rests ultimately with those most closely affected by the innovation

The majority of this section is highlighting the difference between the top down adn bottom up perspectives of how and why implementation is brought about. I don't think it is all to relevant for the time being.

## Innovation and Institutional Theory

This is the real meat and potatoes of the chapter. I would like to frame these three topics well

### Rational Choice Institutionalism

> emphasizes the individual's role in innovation processes

Individuals promote change because it is know that it is most beneficial for them to change. This means change occurs when individuals are not content with the current course of action. Due to the inherent valuing of individuals, innovation will only persist for as long as it proves more perceived value.
Assumes full knowledge of the cost and benefits of actions.

### Historical Institutionalism

> explores the areas and structure within which innovation happens


While individuals are still responsible for creating innovation the focus is shifted to the structure that the individual is working within. Not all individuals have the same ability to initiate innovation and often actions are obstructed if the changes brought about through the innovation negatively effect those with the most power. This structure also constrains the rate of change at which innovation can take place. This historical inertia means the institutions tend to move forward based on past actions.

> The implication is that individuals seeking change in the status qou must operate within a historical institutional structure, which is characterized by substantial inertia and tendencies toward maintaining the status quo.


### Sociological Institutionalism

> considers the larger cultural and cognitive aspects that frame the institutional structures withi which innovation takes place

Largely a counter to the rational choice theory, sociological institutionalism believe that there are a multitude of reason as to why individual seek innovation. It rejects that idea that individuals make choice because they are the most efficient or best suited and focuses more on the concept of 'embeddedness'. This is a term to describe how once an individual has created a specific routine it because the right way. This routine can entrench individuals because it create the frame of thought from which it becomes more and more difficult to see out off.  This "schemata of interpretation" as defined by Goffman, allows individuals "to locate, perceive, and label" the experiences that have in the world. It is these defined relationships that will foremost define the willingness of an individual to accept a particular change. What is essential to keep in mind is that because of this embeddedness it is not fair to expect individuals to understand the multitude of cultural, political, and social influences that are effecting their own personal beliefs. We struggle to see out of our own frame of reference.

##Framework for analysis
When interpreting the and how an why an innovation occurs and is maintained there are multiple factors that should be taken into consideration. These features fall under three primary categories

1. Individual
What is effective the individual persons action
2. Structures
Institutional level rules and regulations
3. Culture
Ideals and circumstances beyond the regulatory level

**individual**
It is important to examine the adoption of change at this level because most of the people effective by a process will be set here.
- Motivation
why do people want to change
- norms and harmony
norms preserve harmony and ensure the quality of the workplace individuals generally will work to preserve this quality
- congruence
What is the level of agreement between the different structural levels of the institution. How do the values align

**structures**
This could be view as the area in which the efforts for change and acceptance take place. It is beyond the actions of individuals
- rules and communication
How is information shared. what restrictions are in place
- incentives
how does the structure promote the adaption of change
- opening
What space is present for the change to occupy
- rÃ©sistance
what forces are attempting to maintain the current status quo

**culture**
These are features that take place outside of the institution
- shocks
drastic events that create awareness and opening for change to occur. Breaking individuals out of there own frame
- framing
creation of an alternative means of viewing a process. Focus on collective action
- legitimacy
new practice enhance the social legitimacy

> The hypothesis posited here suggests that when the individual, structural, and cultural categories are aligned and sustained , then the probability increase that innovation is implemented.
